See your Cardmember Agreement. Your Cardmember Agreement contains all the terms 
of your Account.
 Report immediately! Call 1-800-347-2683.
You may pay all or part of your Account balance at any time. However, you 
must pay at least the Minimum Payment Due by the Payment Due Date. Send only your 
allowable form of payment ("Payment") and the bottom portion of this statement in the 
envelope provided, after affixing postage. Payments sent without proper postage will 
be returned to the sender. If you pay by check, you authorize us to use information on 
your check to make an electronic fund transfer from your account at the financial 
institution indicated on your check or to process the payment as a check transaction. If 
a Payment is processed as an electronic fund transfer, the transfer will be for the 
amount of the check, funds may be withdrawn from your account as soon as the same 
day we receive your check, and you will not receive your check back.
 Sending cash is not allowed. The processing of your 
allowable form of Payment may be delayed if you send cash or correspondence with 
your Payments, if you send the Payment to any other address, or if you use an envelope 
other than the one provided. Payments received at our processing facility by 5PM local 
time on any day will be credited to your Account as of that day. Payments received at 
our processing facility after 5PM local time will be credited to your Account as of the 
next day. If you have misplaced your envelope, send your Payment to Discover, PO Box 
6103, Carol Stream, IL 60197-6103. Please allow 7-10 days for delivery. If your 
Payment is returned unpaid, we reserve the right to resubmit it as an electronic debit. 
You can also make a Payment or set up automatic payments by calling 1-800-347- 
2683.  Automatic payments for the billing period shown on your statement will be 
deducted on the Payment Due Date shown on that statement, or the next automatic 
payment date referred to on your statement, unless you request a recurring payment 
date that occurs before your Payment Due Date. In order to schedule monthly 
payments by telephone, you will need this statement and your bank account 
information. You will be asked to provide the last four (4) digits of the social security 
number of the primary borrower as your electronic signature. By providing those 
numbers, you will be agreeing to this authorization to allow us and your bank to deduct 
each payment you authorize, in the amount selected by you, from your bank account. 
You also authorize us to initiate debit or credit entries to your bank account, as 
applicable, to correct an error in the processing of such payment. You can cancel or 
modify a payment from your bank account until 5:00 PM Eastern Time on the day such 
payment is scheduled by calling 1-800-347-2683 or by mail at Discover, PO Box 
30421, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0421. Same day online or phone payments from bank 
account made after 5:00 PM Eastern Time may be modified before Midnight Eastern 
Time of that day. Payments from Cashback Bonus cannot be modified or cancelled 
after being made or scheduled.
If your payments may vary in amount, we will tell you on each monthly billing 
statement when your payment will be made and how much it will be. You must ensure 
that sufficient funds are available in your bank account, and all transactions must 
comply with U.S. law. 
You can set up automatic payments for: (i) statement New Balance, (ii) statement 
Minimum Payment Due, (iii) statement Minimum Payment Due plus a fixed dollar 
amount, or (iv) other dollar amount.  If your scheduled "Other dollar amount" payment 
is not enough to cover the Minimum Payment Due as listed on your monthly billing 
statement, your scheduled payment for that month will be increased to cover the 
Minimum Payment Due. If the scheduled payment is greater than the Minimum 
Payment Due, any excess will be applied in accordance with your Cardmember 
Agreement. If your scheduled payment is greater than the New Balance on your billing 
statement, that payment will be processed only for the amount of your New Balance. 
Your automatic payment amount may be less than the amount indicated on the billing 
statement based on credits or payments after the Close Date.
If you enroll by phone in our automatic payment service, please fill-in the following 
blanks below and retain the authorization for your records.

 Credit Reporting. We may report information about your Account to 
credit bureaus. Late payments, missed payments, or other defaults on your Account 
may be reflected in your credit report. We normally report the status and payment 
history of your Account to credit reporting agencies each month. If you believe that our 
report is inaccurate or incomplete, please write us at this address: Discover, PO Box 
30939, Salt Lake City, UT 84130-0939. Please include your name, address, home 
telephone number and Account number.
 Your due date is at least 25 days after the close of each billing period.
We will begin charging interest on Cash Advances and Balance Transfers as of the later 
of the Transaction Date or the first day of the billing period in which the transaction 
posted to your Account. If you pay the New Balance on your current billing statement 
by the Payment Due Date shown on that billing statement, we will not impose interest 
charges on New Purchases. New Purchases are Purchases that first appear on the next 
billing statement. Interest will continue to accrue each day on purchases that appeared
on previous billing statements until you pay the New Balance in full and will be billed 
in the next billing cycle.
 We Use the Daily Balance Method (including 
current transactions) to calculate the Balance Subject to Interest Rate. For more 
information, please call us at 1-800-347-2683.
 Your statement shows a Balance Subject to Interest 
Rate. It shows this for each transaction category. The Balance Subject to Interest Rate 
is the average of the daily balances during the billing period.
 If your Account has a credit balance, the amount is shown on the 
front of your billing statement. A credit balance is money that is owed to you. You may 
make charges against this amount if your Account is open. We will send you a refund of
any remaining balance of $1.00 or more after 6 months, or as otherwise required by 
applicable law, or upon request made to the address in the Contact Us section on page
3 of your billing statement.
 Your account may not always be eligible for balance transfers.
Balance transfers accrue interest at the standard purchase rate unless we tell you
otherwise.
Send inquiries to Discover, PO Box 30943, Salt Lake City, UT 84130

your Statement Closing Date will be credited as of the same day; on your Statement
